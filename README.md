# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office

This project explores the trends in Netflix movie durations over the years, aiming to validate the claim that movie lengths have been decreasing. The analysis involves creating visualizations, subsetting data, and identifying genres that contribute to shorter durations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes information on Netflix movies, with details such as release year, duration, genre, and country. The main dataset is sourced from [Netflix Data](datasets).

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The initial analysis involved creating a dictionary and pandas DataFrame to visualize movie durations over the years. The data was then further explored with the inclusion of a larger dataset to gain more insights.

## Visualization

Visualizations were created using matplotlib to represent trends in movie durations. Scatter plots were used to identify patterns, and different colors were assigned to specific genres to distinguish their impact on average durations.

## Insights

The analysis revealed a general trend of decreasing movie durations over the years. Specific genres such as Children, Documentaries, and Stand-Up were identified as contributing to shorter movie lengths.

## Next Steps

Potential areas for further analysis include:
- Statistical analysis to quantify trends.
- In-depth exploration of genre-specific trends.
- Comparative analysis across different countries or regions.
